class Batcher(object):
    """Creates iterators over batches of items. Assuming a sequence of items,
    the created iterator yields either the indices that can be used to select
    a subset of items from a sequence, or, if a sequence is provided, the
    actual item subsets.
    
    A Batcher is highly configurable in terms of the starting and ending points
    of the iteration. The first batch starts at index 0 unless `item_start`
    defines a new starting index. The last index returned is defined as the
    minimum determined collectively from `item_stop`, `item_limit`,
    `batch_stop`, `batch_size`, and `batch_step`. The item-level limits override 
    the batch-level limits. The actual number of batches generated is:
    
    min(
        ceil(min(item_limit, (item_stop-item_start)) / batch_size),
        len(range(batch_start, batch_stop, batch_step))
    )

    Args:
        item_start: The first item to return.
        item_stop: The last item to return, or None for all items.
        item_limit: The maximum number of items to return.
        batch_start: The first batch to return.
        batch_stop: The last batch to return.
        batch_size: The size of each batch.
        batch_step: The number of batches to advance between successive 
            iterations.
        progress: Whether to wrap the iterator in a progress bar.
    
    Examples:
        # Given a sequence of size 10, we define a batcher that yields 3 batches 
        # of 2 items each and a final batch of 1 item.
